# Pseudocode.md
- Plain language description of the steps in an algorithm or a program.
- Bridge between the program's logic and the actual code.

## Importance
- Helps to understand and plan the program logic, so it's easier to code. 
- Improves collaborations in team projects 
- Helps with troubleshooting
- Identify the core areas of the programing that needs to be done.

## Characteristics:
- Plain language: Simple and understandable
- Stuctured: Follows a proper logic sequence
- Abstracted: Focuses on logic more than the syntax
- Detailed: Thorough walkthrough that helps explain the logic

## Basic Constructs:

- Sequential 
```
    Step 1: Do this
    Step 2: Do that
```

- Conditional
```
    If condition matches THEN
        Do something
    Else
        Do something else
        END IF
```
- Loops
```
    WHILE condition meets
        Do something
    END WHILE
```

```
    FOR EACH item in collection
        DO something
    END FOR
```

## Practical Examples

- Example 1: Calculating the sum of a list of numbers
```
    Initialise sum to 0
    FOR each number in the list
        ADD the number to sum
    END FOR
    Print sum
```

- Example 2: Finding the maximum number in a list
```
    Initialise max to the first number of the list
    FOR each number in the list
        IF number is greater than max THEN
            Set mac to number
        END IF
    END FOR
    Print max
```
